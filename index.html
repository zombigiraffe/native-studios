                            perfecting our desired sound. We couldn't be any happier with the end result and if we were

                        <q>I've made the trip to Native Studios numerous times while working with Josh and it has always
                            been a pleasant experience. Native Studios has always provided a welcoming environment where
                            I have been able to relax and fully take advantage of my creativity while recording. Josh
                            brings to the table an extensive knowledge of music and a welcoming personality which both
                            make the recording process a fun and exciting experience. I highly recommend Native Studios

                        <q>Josh Engle is one of the most kind and professional engineers I’ve had the pleasure of
                            working with. From the moment I was introduced to Josh, to the moment we recorded our first
                            track he’s been very helpful, communicative, understanding and extremely knowledgeable. Not
                            to mention the top of the line gear you’re working with in his studio is beyond fantastic.
                            Josh is full of ideas and is open to collaborate wherever he thinks your song needs work.
                            He’s respectful and honest with you and will tell you when a part simply is off or doesn’t
                            fit. My favorite thing about working with Josh is his motivation throughout the recording
                            process, he’s always positive and putting a lot into the music itself. I strongly strongly
                            recommend working with this great engineer and person. His prices are fiar and you’re
                            getting great quality work from someone who actually cares and knows what they’re doing.

                        <q>Working with Josh is god-mode on multiple levels. From the affordability, to the comfortable
                            atmosphere. Receiving draft mixes was always timely and Josh was always willing to sit down
                            and get the perfect sound on a part. If you're into creative recording you will also enjoy
                            recording here, for one of my percussion parts we literally just beat up his ceiling. Record
                            with Native Studios.</q>

                        <q>I’ve spent many hours at Native Studios working on countless projects with Josh. The thing I
                            can attest to the most is the ease of working with him. From conception of idea until the
                            final mix of your song, the process is simple with him. Not only is his understanding of
                            sound engineering incredibly robust, his skill as a musician is also incredible as well.
                            Working with Josh at Native Studios is kind of like going to your favorite store and having
                            everything you want/need be on sale that day. Using him and his knowledge/understanding of
                            music gets you the best of both worlds. It gets you quality sound engineering that won’t
                            break your bank. Book your next project here and finally release those songs you’ve always
                            wanted to. </q>

                    <div class="mySlides">
                        <q>I’ve been in a band with Josh for over 4 years, and I’ve spent many hours at Native Studios.
                            It’s a great environment to be creative in and there’s always good vibes. Josh’s attention
                            to detail with songwriting and recording/production is immaculate, and you can see
                            tremendous progress and improvement with everything he releases. The software and hardware
                            he has available at his studio is professional grade and allows the artist to experiment
                            with a lot of ideas, especially with production/post-production due to Josh’s expansive
                            plugin/production tools. He has a great collection of guitars that can be utilized for
                            records, but artists are able to bring any of their own hardware/gear. The studio space
                            allows for live drum recording which bumps up the professional quality of any song. I would
                            highly recommend working with Josh on your next song/EP/album.</q>
